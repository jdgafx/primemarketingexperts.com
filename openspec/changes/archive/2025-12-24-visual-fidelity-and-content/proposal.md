# Change Proposal: Visual Fidelity & Content Expansion

## Why
Fix the visual divergence of the Clone site to match `primemarketingexperts.com` exactly, and expand the Brand site with missing content pages.

## What Changes
### In Scope:
1. **Clone Site Visual Overhaul:**
    - Replace generic generic hero with exact "Driving Excellence" style detailed in user feedback.
    - Implement correct Logo usage (PME).
    - Match exact font weights, spacing, and button styles (Orange gradient).
    - Fix Navigation bar layout to match original.
2. **Brand Site Content Expansion:**
    - Build `About` page (Michael Krieger profile).
    - Build `Contact` page with form.
    - Ensure all navigation links work.

### Out of Scope:
1. Backend integration.
2. New functionality not specified.

## Constraints
1. **Clone Site:** Must pass "squint test" comparison with original.
2. **Brand Site:** Must remain "dark mode" and shadcn-based.

## Success Criteria
1. ✅ Clone site Hero section matches user provided screenshot exactly.
2. ✅ Clone site Navigation matches original exactly.
3. ✅ Brand site has functional About and Contact pages.
4. ✅ Start script runs both sites successfully.
