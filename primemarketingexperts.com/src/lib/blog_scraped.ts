      "It has become imperative for businesses to deploy marketing automation to remain competitive. In particular, sales teams typically experience a 50% productivity increase post-implementation. When buying a marketing automation tool, it's crucial to implement it strategically to maximize its benefits.",
      "We need to rethink content creation because it's crucial for businesses. Generally, any URL contains content at some level, whether it is words, photographs, or videos. Content must connect with your target market to attract new customers and strengthen relationships with existing ones.",
      "There is a vast array of potential content that you could incorporate into your marketing initiatives.",
      "Link to thought leader accounts on social media. Compose a post like, “Do you follow Malcolm Gladwell? He is one of my favorite thought leaders!”",
      "Link to questions on Quora, i.e. “Did you see this discussion on the importance of marketing automation? There are some best practices that you should implement.”",
      "Share a link to a blog relevant to your customers. You could post, “Here is a blog post you should read on how to manage lead scoring in the CRM of your marketing automation system.”",
      "Post a link to a useful SlideShare presentation with the message: \"Check out this informative guide on how salespeople can use your marketing automation system.\"",
      "These links direct users to a landing page where you encourage them to share their contact information for content that interests them.",
      "Planning your marketing automation strategy should also begin with defining your buyer personas. These are fictitious customer profiles that are reflective of the different types of customers, influencers, and prospects of your business. You will tailor your workflows and how you personalize your marketing based on your buyer personas. A persona profile may include demographic information, job title, industry, education, and challenges they face."

So, let’s dive into the world of cryptocurrency market-making and learn how it can benefit investors and token projects.",
      "Market making in crypto has a significant role to play, just like their counterparts in traditional finance. These entities, often specialized trading firms or financial institutions, use their capital to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. Thereby, they provide necessary liquidity to the market. This continuous flow of buying and selling activity ensures that trades can be executed swiftly without causing significant price fluctuations, thus stabilizing the crypto market.",

      "Crypto market makers function by setting up a crypto market making strategy that includes maintaining a list of buy and sell orders. This strategy involves calculating and constantly adjusting the quantities and prices of these orders to reflect the current market conditions. The goal is to minimize the spread and prevent large price gaps, allowing other traders to execute their trades efficiently and at fair prices.",
      "Let’s see how the symmetric market making strategy in crypto works, taking the DOGE coin as an example. This strategy involves continuously placing buy and sell limit orders around the current market price to capture the bid-ask spread while providing liquidity. How this might work for DOGE with its present price of $0,16:",
      "Set fixed spread. The market maker decides on a fixed percentage for the spread, say, 0.2%.",
      "Place orders. The market maker places buy orders at the bid price and sell orders at the ask price, aiming to capture the spread between these two prices."

Marketing automation you to streamline many repetitive and time-consuming marketing activities in relation to communicating with and nurturing your leads.",
      "Read on to see the 5 ways of how marketing automation can enhance lead generation tactics:",
      "Search engine marketing is an effective strategy for generating leads because it serves your ad to customers based on the words they used when searching for something. For example, if your business is a carpet cleaning service and potential customers typed “cleaning service near me” in their search engine, your SEM ad would be displayed above or to the right of the organic search results. With SEM, you know your customer is already searching for the products or services your company provides, making this a valuable lead-generation tactic.",
      "Before we investigate how marketing automation improves this process, here are three steps to get started with SEM:",
      "These are the keywords you think people would type in when searching for the type of products and services your business provides. It’s a good idea to mix it up between long and short search terms not only to give yourself a variety of keywords to choose from but also because the length of the keyword is indicative of where the buyer is in their journey. Someone searching “cleaning services” is more likely at the beginning of their search as opposed to someone searching “cleaning services that use environmentally safe products.” Longer or long-tail keywords are used by customers who are typically better leads because they’ve identified their exact problem and are actively searching for the solution.",
      "Once you’ve identified your keywords, you’re now able to bid on how much you want to pay per click (PPC) on your keywords. One important thing to keep in mind is that shorter keywords may be more competitive and ultimately cost more because shorter search terms are often the broadest. On the flip side of this, long-tail keywords may be cheaper because they’re much more specific. With either short or long-tail keywords, always keep in mind that other marketers in your industry may be bidding on the same keywords, so the higher you can bid the better.",
      "SEM ads are typically more successful as text ads, but you do have the option of using image ads. If using a text ad, it’s crucial to have an engaging and relevant headline with the CTA on the second line. Make sure the copy is relevant to the keywords and keep the copy short (less than 70 characters). If using an image ad, be sure you’re adhering to the search engine’s recommended image sizes to ensure a good viewing experience on desktop and mobile.",
      "Using SEM alone could be highly beneficial, but with marketing automation, it can take your efforts to the next level. Marketing automation allows you to see a more complete picture of which keywords are performing best. While many businesses turn to Google Analytics for a snapshot of how well an SEM ad is driving traffic to their site, Google Analytics can’t provide information on how well Bing ads or other search engine ads performed, but marketing automation tools can. Marketing automation tools let you have a comprehensive view of your SEM efforts by allowing you to see how visitors are interacting and behaving with your ads and website. Because marketing automation enables you to track and connect keywords to a prospect, you will be better able to nurture them into leads by meeting them where they are in the sales funnel with relevant content.",
      "Fans on your social media profile may become leads with the right amount of engagement. Social media advertising helps your company generate new leads through your social media profiles. Social media advertising is different from other lead-generation tactics in that it lets you tailor your ads to a specific demographic. You could choose to target your ad based on a user’s location, interests, education, or marital status as examples of categories you can choose from in defining your target."

Implementing marketing automation helps businesses generate a higher volume of leads from their current website traffic. Marketing automation helps track how users navigate your website, interact with social media, and engage with your email campaigns. The system then calculates a score for each individual user on your website based on their likelihood that they will convert into becoming a customer. You can also automate repetitive tasks, such as sending out lead nurturing emails, as well as monitoring the status of sales and prospects. This will only help your team focus on creating and executing new lead generation campaigns.",

DKIM-based email campaign services, which is included in our marketing automation service, can protect against domain spoofing and phishing attacks. Since these emails are more credible to recipients’ email services, they are more likely to be delivered into the recipients’ inboxes. Therefore, DKIM-based email campaigns typically get a 400% improvement in open rates over non-DKIM-based email campaigns.",

This process streamlines marketing because these contacts have a high likelihood of converting with a properly constructed lead nurturing campaign. In essence, the campaign gradually builds a relationship with these contacts as studies have shown that you need to make an average of 7 touches with a prospect before they convert. We recommend building landing pages with a separate landing page tool, such as Instapage or the integrated tool within our marketing automation service.",

Our most favorite time to deploy them is by triggering a pop up advertisement that appears when users are exiting your website.

      "When thinking about search engine optimization, or SEO, people tend to just think it is the process of how websites or videos can be optimized to appear more prominently within search engines. While this is still a significant part of SEO, businesses with a physical location also need to focus on their local SEO rank to drive increased visibility. Of particular interest, local SEO provides prime visibility when users search for a locally relevant term, which triggers a local search pack that displays 3 nearby businesses immediately under a map. Local search engine rankings are mainly driven by creating citations within business directories to support the visibility of your business.

      "A good email deliverability toolkit should have a combination of the below measures if it cannot be fully adopted. You must factor in Email deliverability for understanding email Performance.",
      "While buying lists can be tempting as it can seem like a fast way of getting results, the truth is that you are starting that relationship from the cold. Many people right from the outset will mark your email as spam, which will result in all of your emails getting sent to spam in the future. In turn, you may be sacrificing some of your ability to send emails to your organically built email list, or even your current customers, into your primary inbox. Use a double opt-in process to confirm that your users want to subscribe to your list that is strategically integrated into your website. If you have a strong blog within your website, you may also want to use content gating to enhance your ability to organically collect email addresses avoiding spam traps or spam complaints",
      "With email deliverability tools, you can improve your domain reputation thereby improving sender reputation so that you can improve Inbox placement of your emails. The tool sends emails to predefined email addresses that reply to your email or transfer it from the spam or promotions folder to the primary inbox. Therefore, your campaigns will then achieve better results since your recipients will receive your email campaigns in their inboxes.",
      "When you use a high-quality email marketing software provider, the delivery rate of your email campaigns and click-through rates can dramatically improve.

We recommend using MailPoet, which is great email marketing software specifically designed to integrate with WordPress websites.

Many digital initiatives like building a website, running online ads, or developing a mobile app require upfront investment. Determine how much you can allocate to your digital presence and marketing efforts. If budgets are tight, focus on affordable tactics like content marketing, social media engagement, and SEO optimization. Leverage free and low-cost tools whenever possible, and track results to calculate your return on investment.",

Ensure your site is mobile-friendly with fast load times. Refresh the content to speak to your target audience better. Include clear calls to action to drive conversions. Update online forms and integrations with marketing automation software. Enhance SEO elements like meta descriptions, tags, and alt text. Improving your website experience aligns with shifting consumer expectations and positions your brand as contemporary and tech-savvy.",
      "Gaining visibility on search engines like Google is imperative for small business growth today. You want your brand to appear prominently in local search results so nearby customers can easily find you. Conduct keyword research to understand high-value terms and phrases related to your products or services.

Add social share buttons across your digital properties to further amplify content. A strategic social media presence lends credibility and gives your small business a voice in the digital landscape.",
      "While digital marketing starts with your owned channels like your website and social profiles, you also want to tap into other online real estate. Building partnerships with your industry’s popular local blogs, podcasts, and influencers allows you to tap into their engaged audiences. Consider guest posting on high-domain-authority sites related to your niche to build links and drive referral traffic. Distributing educational content on Medium, YouTube, and LinkedIn platforms helps establish thought leadership. Leverage customer review sites like Yelp to gain trust and credibility. Paid ads on Google, Facebook, and Instagram are a cost-efficient way to get your brand in front of motivated users. Expanding beyond your website and social pages grows your digital footprint.",

AI-powered chatbots can handle routine customer inquiries to improve response times. Automated messaging via SMS and email nurtures leads and retains customers. Tools like inventory management software, eCommerce integrations, and payroll systems streamline back-end processes. Analytics dashboards surface data-driven insights to inform decision-making. While AI adoption requires some learning and investment upfront, the long-term productivity gains allow small business owners to focus their time on higher-value initiatives. The right automation makes operations more agile and cost-effective.",
      "Today’s consumers rely on smartphones for everything, including finding local businesses, so optimizing for mobile needs to be a priority. Start with the basics, like ensuring your website is responsive on all devices. Test pages for speed and usability. Adapt page layouts and calls-to-action for smaller screens. Develop your brand’s mobile app to facilitate bookings, transactions, and engagement. Publish location-based push notifications to drive foot traffic to your store. Integrate click-to-call functionality for instant connections. Evaluate emerging technologies like augmented reality to creatively engage mobile users. As mobile continues to dominate, small businesses should tap into this always-on channel.",
      "Small businesses can unlock new online opportunities to acquire customers, build credibility, and sustain long-term growth by implementing the right mix of digital strategies tailored to your niche. With consumer expectations and behaviors rapidly evolving in the digital age, keeping pace with technological innovations and trends is essential. The brands leveraging their digital presence and harnessing data-driven insights will be best positioned to thrive in the modern marketplace. While digital transformation requires commitment and learning, the effort pays dividends through improved competitiveness, productivity, and profitability."
