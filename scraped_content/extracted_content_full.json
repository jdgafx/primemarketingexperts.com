This strategy frees up time for building deeper relationships, which can boost sales.",

      "Market making in crypto has a significant role to play, just like their counterparts in traditional finance. These entities, often specialized trading firms or financial institutions, use their capital to buy and sell cryptocurrencies. Thereby, they provide necessary liquidity to the market. This continuous flow of buying and selling activity ensures that trades can be executed swiftly without causing significant price fluctuations, thus stabilizing the crypto market.",
      "Crypto market makers use advanced algorithmic trading strategies to maintain an active presence on both sides of the order book, helping to narrow the bid-ask spread. Spread is the difference between the highest price a buyer is willing to pay and the lowest price a seller is willing to accept.",
      "The necessity of utilizing crypto market making services arises from the volatility and sometimes illiquid nature of cryptocurrency markets. Market makers reduce these challenges by enhancing market depth and liquidity. This, in turn, facilitates smoother transactions and more stable prices for traders and investors. Market makers are essential for both large-cap assets such as BTC (with a market cap of $ 1,283.65 billion), DOGE (Dogecoin market cap is $23.73 billion), and others, as well as for low-cap assets that require trading volume increase.",
      "Crypto market makers function by setting up a crypto market making strategy that includes maintaining a list of buy and sell orders. This strategy involves calculating and constantly adjusting the quantities and prices of these orders to reflect the current market conditions. The goal is to minimize the spread and prevent large price gaps, allowing other traders to execute their trades efficiently and at fair prices.",
      "Let’s see how the symmetric market making strategy in crypto works, taking the DOGE coin as an example. This strategy involves continuously placing buy and sell limit orders around the current market price to capture the bid-ask spread while providing liquidity. How this might work for DOGE with its present price of $0,16:",
      "Set fixed spread. The market maker decides on a fixed percentage for the spread, say, 0.2%."

      "Popups can be created easily through the following methods:",

      "Are you looking to increase profitability by generating high-quality leads from your website? Do you often feel short on time and find it challenging to integrate important business development tasks into your day? The largest bottleneck to business growth is time, especially considering that every business has objectives to meet. Relieve that bottleneck by&nbsp;deploying a marketing automation tool&nbsp;to help reduce the time required to manage lead generation processes.",
      "Many businesses aim to boost their website traffic through social media, SEO, or advertising, but that's only part of the challenge. Maximizing website traffic is pointless if it doesn't contribute to your business growth and profits. Engage your customers effectively during their buying journey, as it often takes seven interactions for them to feel ready to do business with you.",
      "To establish an effective lead generation campaign, you first need to define your targeted customer personas.&nbsp;To help you do this, you may want to consider running polls on social media and by interviewing your customers. Depending on the exact dynamics of your company, you may have multiple services that appeal to different customer personas. Your buyer personas only can help your company improve its brand messaging, and become more engaging with its ideal customers. Focus on your top 3 or 4 customer personas, as they account for 90% of a company's sales, according to Mark W. Schaefer's study. Then, prioritize your personas so that your company dedicates a higher level of resources to ones with higher growth potential.",
      "Create a landing page that clearly communicates your unique value to your target customer. Create a form to gather user contact information in exchange for free content, which will be sent through an automated email. Allow the user to download the content through a link in the email. Be sure to place the inquiry form in a place such that a visitor does not need to scroll to see the form. Next, encourage the user with a call to action that advances their buying journey.",
      "Don’t forget to send lead nurturing emails to remain top of mind and continue building a relationship with your prospects. Of course, you ultimately would want the prospect to purchase your service. Though, you would want to ensure that you do not annoy prospects by just sending out a link to buy your offering. Instead, offer additional content that is of interest to the prospect, introduce complementary offerings, or advertise a limited-time promotion. After adding more content to your emails, include a call to action below it to make it easy for prospects to purchase your service. Lead nurturing is most effective when you use collected data to personalize emails, generating 18 times more revenue than standard broadcasts.",
      "The real power of marketing automation then shows up when lead scoring is leveraged to dynamically prioritize your CRM. Lead scoring includes a user's interactions on websites, social media, and email campaigns. Tracking begins when a customer submits their information on a landing page or clicks on a received email. Higher lead scores indicate prospects more likely to purchase, allowing your sales team to focus on those most likely to convert.",
      "We recommend strategically following this process using a reputable marketing automation tool. Achieving ROI is easy because the savings from increased productivity usually outweigh the software costs, even with just one sales employee. A marketing automation tool can enhance your lead generation strategy and increase your business's long-term success.",

Marketing automation you to streamline many repetitive and time-consuming marketing activities in relation to communicating with and nurturing your leads.",
      "Read on to see the 5 ways of how marketing automation can enhance lead generation tactics:",
      "Search engine marketing is an effective strategy for generating leads because it serves your ad to customers based on the words they used when searching for something. For example, if your business is a carpet cleaning service and potential customers typed “cleaning service near me” in their search engine, your SEM ad would be displayed above or to the right of the organic search results. With SEM, you know your customer is already searching for the products or services your company provides, making this a valuable lead-generation tactic.",
      "Before we investigate how marketing automation improves this process, here are three steps to get started with SEM:",
      "These are the keywords you think people would type in when searching for the type of products and services your business provides. It’s a good idea to mix it up between long and short search terms not only to give yourself a variety of keywords to choose from but also because the length of the keyword is indicative of where the buyer is in their journey. Someone searching “cleaning services” is more likely at the beginning of their search as opposed to someone searching “cleaning services that use environmentally safe products.” Longer or long-tail keywords are used by customers who are typically better leads because they’ve identified their exact problem and are actively searching for the solution.",
      "Once you’ve identified your keywords, you’re now able to bid on how much you want to pay per click (PPC) on your keywords. One important thing to keep in mind is that shorter keywords may be more competitive and ultimately cost more because shorter search terms are often the broadest. On the flip side of this, long-tail keywords may be cheaper because they’re much more specific. With either short or long-tail keywords, always keep in mind that other marketers in your industry may be bidding on the same keywords, so the higher you can bid the better.",
      "SEM ads are typically more successful as text ads, but you do have the option of using image ads. If using a text ad, it’s crucial to have an engaging and relevant headline with the CTA on the second line. Make sure the copy is relevant to the keywords and keep the copy short (less than 70 characters). If using an image ad, be sure you’re adhering to the search engine’s recommended image sizes to ensure a good viewing experience on desktop and mobile.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;",
      "Using SEM alone could be highly beneficial, but with marketing automation, it can take your efforts to the next level. Marketing automation allows you to see a more complete picture of which keywords are performing best. While many businesses turn to Google Analytics for a snapshot of how well an SEM ad is driving traffic to their site, Google Analytics can’t provide information on how well Bing ads or other search engine ads performed, but marketing automation tools can. Marketing automation tools let you have a comprehensive view of your SEM efforts by allowing you to see how visitors are interacting and behaving with your ads and website. Because marketing automation enables you to track and connect keywords to a prospect, you will be better able to nurture them into leads by meeting them where they are in the sales funnel with relevant content."

      "Marketing automation&nbsp;is a blend of 8 different marketing technology tools that work together to simplify your business and to maximize the results of your marketing campaign. It is a proven way to increase revenue through boosted conversion rates, especially in businesses that have a higher profitability per sale and longer sales cycles. Implementing marketing automation helps businesses generate a higher volume of leads from their current website traffic. Marketing automation helps track how users navigate your website, interact&nbsp;with social media, and engage&nbsp;with your email campaigns. The system then calculates&nbsp;a score for&nbsp;each individual user on your website based on their likelihood that they will convert into becoming a customer. You can also automate repetitive tasks, such as sending out lead nurturing emails, as well as monitoring the status of sales and prospects. This will only help your team focus on creating and executing new lead generation campaigns.",
      "However, many businesses are reluctant to deploy marketing automation solutions due to the associated cost. Fear not! We like calculating ROI as well. In our experience, we find that clients can make ROI from marketing automation services when accounting for the increased productivity of just one salesperson in most cases.",
      "Especially that email is one of the least costly ways to market your business, upgrading your email service to a platform with DomainKeys Identified Mail&nbsp;(DKIM) is critical if your business has a large email contact list. DKIM-based email campaign services, which is included in our&nbsp;marketing automation service, can protect against domain spoofing and phishing attacks. Since these emails are more credible to recipients’ email services, they are more likely to be delivered into the recipients’ inboxes. Therefore, DKIM-based email campaigns&nbsp;typically get a 400% improvement in open rates over non-DKIM-based email campaigns.",
      "Deploying landing pages drives results as you are effectively collecting prospect information on your website. In essence, you would offer something that your website visitors would value, such as a white paper or a free shipping coupon, in exchange for key contact information such as an email address and a phone number. In turn, you build a list of email addresses from prospects that you may market to repeatedly. This process streamlines marketing&nbsp;because these contacts have a high likelihood of converting with a properly constructed lead nurturing campaign. In essence, the campaign gradually builds a relationship with these contacts as studies have shown that you need to make an average of 7 touches with a prospect&nbsp;before they convert. We recommend building landing pages with a separate landing page tool, such as&nbsp;Instapage&nbsp;or the integrated tool within our&nbsp;marketing automation service.",
      "Creating visually stunning offers through leveraging marketing technology&nbsp;can help reduce cart abandonment or build an email list. Our most favorite time to deploy them is by triggering a pop up advertisement that appears when users are exiting your website. Though, you can opt to create the offer in more subtle ways, including by having bars on top or on the side of your webpages.&nbsp;We recommend integrating&nbsp;OptInMonster&nbsp;which offers a best in class platform to easily incorporate these offers into your website.",
      "Heat map tools provide a visual representation of what users care about most in your website by tracking clicks on your website. You can then utilize this data to more effectively make decisions on how to better optimize the placement of your website elements. Heat maps also may deliver information on where users are clicking. Perhaps you have an icon on a website that is not linked to another area of your website, but people are expecting to view more information on a specific aspect of your service. You can clearly see the degree of user intent your website visitor base has through viewing the degree of heat pictured in each page’s heat map. In contrast, you cannot see this if you are using Google Analytics, especially if you have the same link on multiple areas of the same page.",

      "Michael Krieger",
      "When thinking about&nbsp;search engine optimization, or SEO, people tend to just think it is the process of how websites or videos can be optimized to appear more prominently within search engines. While this is still a significant part of SEO, businesses with a physical location also need to focus on their local SEO rank to drive increased visibility. Of particular interest, local SEO provides prime visibility when users search for a locally relevant term, which triggers a local search pack that displays 3 nearby businesses immediately under a map. Local search engine rankings are mainly driven by creating citations within business directories to support the visibility of your business. These searches give customers the option to call your local business directly, read recent reviews, or get directions to your location. Businesses that service their customers in-person can boost their visibility online by making sure their business shows up in search results when users need to find them.",
      "Google Local Search Pack Displayed When Searching “Plumber Boston.”",
      "Before setting up your local business listing, you’ll first want to check your eligibility to create a listing within Google My Business (GMB). Online-only businesses, artists, and organizations are not eligible for a Google My Business listing. Check each platform’s guidelines on what determines eligibility.",
      "When you have determined that you are eligible to list on specific platforms, you would want to check if a listing already exists for the business. Sometimes there may discover that you have a profile when you are not aware one is present, though it may be severely basic and incomplete. Having complete and correct information within your business listing improves your ranking when users search for terms relevant to the business category.",
      "To claim your listing, you’ll want to review the information that may have already been provided to ensure accurate information, especially since consistency is key. Each platform is different, but the basic information that helps search engines geolocate your business includes business name, address, and phone number, which is often referred to as NAP. Including a business description and links to social media accounts often enhances it further. Some even allow you to upload other media such as menus and pictures of your business. Once you’ve updated or corrected the information, you may have to proceed through an email, phone, or mail verification process as required by each platform.",
      "When you have verified your business listings and have established a profile on the greatest amount of business directories, traditional SEO comes into play to further improve your local SEO ranking. This starts with keyword research to use for your content, which will improve your SEO ranking. Begin by researching what your customers search for. Then, plan content around those topics to improve your ranking in a platform’s search results.",
      "If you are a local custom furniture shop, you could write a blog about repurposing an old chair or distressed furniture. Long-tail keywords for these topics are likely to be “how to repurpose a chair” or “how to restore distressed furniture.” The short-tail keywords would more likely be “repurpose chair” and “restore furniture.” Researching keywords that best fit your business gives you the best chance to produce useful content around what your customers are searching for. In researching keywords, you could even create content based on search trends that are relevant to the services you offer.",
      "Focus more on short-tail keywords. Typically when focusing on&nbsp;search engine marketing, or SEM, long-tail keywords are the way to go because a customer is closer to finding the solution to their need. Long-tail keywords are always useful, however with local SEO, you’ll want to pay attention to short-tail keywords because of the volume of searches, plus it may trigger local SEO. There is no bidding with local SEO, but since short-tail keywords are more likely to be competitive, planning your content to achieve high local search ranking becomes even more important. Try experimenting by entering different searches to see which keywords trigger the local search pack for your area. In the screenshot below, the search term “emergency plumbing,” triggered local SEO even without the words “near me” or the name of the city in the search."

      "Build an audience",
      "Before starting any email marketing, make sure you have an email list of individuals or organizations in your target market.&nbsp;Email marketing has evolved from mass email blasts to targeted, market-specific campaigns. Today, businesses focus less on mass email communication and more on strategically addressing market needs. Did you know that about 99% of website visitors don’t usually take any action on their first visit? So how do you capture this audience – most of which may never visit your website again?",
      "Building an audience takes effort. You need to research and strategically grow your email list with contacts that fit your target demographics. A website opt-in is a great place to&nbsp;capture your potential market. The other key strategy to build an email list is to&nbsp;deploy lead magnets. A lead magnet is an enticing offer provided by a business in exchange for a potential client's contact information. It can be anything, like a contact form for newsletter sign-ups, quote requests, or coupon downloads!"

      "Successful business owners differentiate their companies to effectively grow sales profitably, while improving client loyalty within a competitive business environment.

      "Increase Your Value Perception&nbsp;-When customers perceive that your product’s value, stylishness, or class is differentiated, your sales increase because of your offering’s improved value proposition. Businesses often differentiate themselves by creating a perception that they offer better quality given the price they pay.Simply becoming the lowest cost supplier can be the most ideal strategy when you are selling a commodity when you have no other opportunity to differentiate.Many businesses find that highlighting donations triggerred by sales increases value perception because it makes their customers happy as they perceive that the business is involved in the community.

However, business owners who deploy this tactic must analyze whether they would be profitably increasing sales as this increases operating costs.Creating an exclusive club that offers your clients experiences only available through your business or by spending a certain amount of money each year could differentiate your business. On the same token, offering a more luxurious experience may result in customers going to great lengths to patronize your business.",
      "Improve the Perceived Quality or Opulence of Your Offering&nbsp;– Established brands could whip you out of the market because of their financial muscle and their more developed brand perception. To beat them, you need to focus on other areas apart from the price, such as the quality or opulence of your offering.For example, a candy business could differentiate its product on taste, convenient packaging, or ingredients. As such, the consumer is willing to pay a premium for the additional value created by this differentiation. Luxury car manufacturers could associate their vehicles with class and style as wealthier customers will easily be willing to pay a higher price due to the opulence and the status symbol that the car offers.",
